# FTMK-Traffic-Administrative-System

FTMK Traffic Administration system is a system that uses mobile application as a platform and AI techniques that can help the university to monitor and manage the people entering the place. The problem they are facing now with the current system is manpower, monitoring and displaying lecturer availability, and at last parking availability. Because of this, some students don’t know the lecturer their searching is available or not, students can’t find parking spot and students taking lecturer parking spot while leaving lecturers without a place to park.

In this FTMK Traffic Administration system, we use our laptop camera to detect the number plate of cars and monitor who enter and out using our firebase database. Thus, lecturer availability will be updated based on the details. After that, students and lecturers can check their app for parking availability and university can fine the students who ever parked at wrong parking spot. By using this system, it will make students easier to plan meetings with lecturers, find parking before entering the place, and it will be easier for university admin to monitor everything with precision.
